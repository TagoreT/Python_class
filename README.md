# Python Class Repository

Welcome to the Python Class Repository! This repository contains Python scripts and resources for learning and practicing Python programming.

## Using Google Colab

Google Colab is a free cloud service that allows you to run Python code in a Jupyter notebook environment. It is a great tool for running your Python scripts without needing to install anything on your local machine.

1. Open Google Colab in your browser: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

2. To use a notebook with this GitHub link in Google Colab:
    - Click on the `File` menu.
    - Select `Open notebook`.
    - Click on the `GitHub` tab.
    - Enter the URL of the other GitHub repository: `https://github.com/TagoreT/Python_class`
    - Select the notebook file `.ipynb` or `.py` file you want to work with.
    - Alternatively, you can directly open the notebook in Colab using the following link:
      - `https://colab.research.google.com/github/TagoreT/Python_class/notebook_name.ipynb`

Replace `notebook_name.ipynb` with the appropriate file name.

3. Connect Google Colab to your GitHub repository:
    - Click on the `File` menu.
    - Select `Open notebook`.
    - Click on the `GitHub` tab.
    - Authenticate with your GitHub account if prompted.
    - Enter the URL of your repository: `https://github.com/your-username/python-class`
    - Select the `.py` or `.ipynb` file you want to work with.

4. Alternatively, you can upload a `.py` or `.ipynb` file directly to Colab:
    - Click on the `File` menu.
    - Select `Upload notebook`.
    - Choose the file from your local machine.

5. Once the file is open, you can run the code cells by clicking the play button on the left side of each cell.

Happy coding!
